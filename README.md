## Description

This website is designed to showcase my previous work to potential employers. 
It shows what I have learned as a coding bootcamp student. I applied the skills I have learned into a website. 

I started this project back in April as a way to show what I can do with HTML & CSS. A few months later, I added Bootstrap and Google Fonts to improve my website and rework some of the designs. 

The most time-consuming part of this project is making sure my styling elements work. I ran into issues that did not make my webpage responsive. After some trial and errors, I was able to have a website I'm proud of designing.

Here's a look at the my portfolio: https://cmdnguyen.github.io/Portfolio/

## Usage

When you go into the website, you see the navigation that takes you to each section of the page.

In the About Me section, you can go over to the headshot of me and see that it glows yellow. 
You can actually click on it and it will take you to my LinkedIn page.

In the Work section, you can see my latest work in as the largest image and my previous project as smaller images.
Each image will take you to the live link to the website or the GitHub repository for you to look at.

In the Contact section, there are links on how to get in touch with me. 

You can use ChromeDev Tools to change the screen size and see the layout change.
